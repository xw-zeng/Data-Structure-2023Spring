## Quick Review of Homework

- [1. HW1](#1)
- [2. HW2](#2)
- [3. HW3](#3)
- [4. HW4](#4)
- [5. HW5](#5)



<h3 id="1">HW1. Asymptotic Analysis, Recursion, Stacks</h3>

- This assignment contains asymptotic analysis and comparative anlaysis regarding time complexity of the algorithm; recursion algorithm designs; and some applications of stack abstract data type.
- Deadline: 22:00 March 23rd, 2023.
- My score of this assignment is: **100/100**.
- Bonus question (**10/10**): Tower of Hanoi algorithm (lazy version). 



<h3 id="2">HW2. Queues, Linked Lists, Trees</h3>

- This assignment is about the Python implementation of queues, double-ended queues (deques), singly linked lists, circularly linked lists, doubly linked lists, general trees, and binary trees with linked structure. 
- Deadline: 22:00 April 13th, 2023.
- My score of this assignment is: **100/100**.
- Bonus question (**8/10**): Enhanced binary search trees. I haven't modified my code yet, but I know that the error in this question is failing to correctly update the number of child nodes in the subtree of the ancestor nodes.



<h3 id="3">HW3. Tree Traversal, Priority Queues, Heaps, Hash Tables, AVL Trees</h3>

- This assignment includes the Python implementation of preorder, inorder and postorder traversals of general trees, heap-based priority queues, collision-handling in hash tables, and operations in AVL trees.
- Deadline: 22:00 May 4th, 2023.
- My score of this assignment is: **100/100**.
- Bonus question (**10/10**): In-place heapsort algorithm.



<h3 id="4">HW4. Splay Trees, Red-Black Trees, Sorting, Graph Algorithms</h3>

- This assignment contains the construction rules of splay trees and red-black trees, detailed process of merge-sort and quick-sort, and the graph algorithms.
- Deadline: 22:00 June 1st, 2023.
- My score of this assignment is: **100/100**.
- Bonus question (**10/10**): Boruvka's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a graph.



<h3 id="5">HW5. Graph Algorithms, Text Processing</h3>

- This assignment requires the understanding of several data structures for graphs (edge list, adjacency list/map/matrix), and implementation of Prim-Jarnik algorithm, Kruskalâ€™s algorithm, pattern-matching algorithms and Hoffman coding algorithm.
- Deadline: 22:00 June 8th, 2023.
- My score of this assignment is: **98/100**. The lost 2 credits are attributed to 1 (d), where I forgot to use $\infty$ to indicate there's no edge between two nodes.
